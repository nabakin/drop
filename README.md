Drop, a LÖVE visualizer and music player
==========

I've always loved music and music visualizations, but mainstream visualizers are frequently packed with features to
the point where they feel cumbersome. They have some neat graphics, but they aren't very good at reflecting the actual beat of
the music. To me they feel like gimics—something that you use once or twice, say "Cool!" and then never use again.
I believe visualizers have a lot of potential integrated into music players and so, I decided to
create Drop; a simple, efficient music player/visualizer.

To add music, either drag and drop your music folder(s) on the window or make sure you run the visualizer at least once, exit, navigate to your system's appdata directory, open "LOVE/Drop/music", and place your music files/folders there.

### Features:
  - drag and drop
  - scrub bar and music controls
  - spectrum visualization
  - realtime fft calculations
  - multiple colors
  - fade-visual sync (temporarily disabled)
  - \[Mac only, see [this](https://github.com/nabakin/drop#researchedunfinished)\] disables visualization when in the background (behind windows or minimized)
  - delay correction
  - bulk sampling
  - fully-scalable

### Controls:
  - Left Arrow: Previous Song
  - Right Arrow: Next Song
  - Space bar: Pause/Play
  - Click the scrub bar to change time
  - Drag the scrub head to change time
  - r, g, and b: change visualization color
  - f: Fullscreen mode
  - 1, 2, 3, and 4: change visualization type
  - Escape: Quit
  - Comma and Period: move frame by frame through the visualization

### TODO:
  - add playlists
  - ~~add a better font~~
  - use decoders to generate SoundData and audio source
  - add more visualizations (folder for custom visualizations?)
  - add fade bloom (maybe)
  - add fade transition softening
  - ~~add drag and drop for music files (love.filedropped/love.directorydropped/love.system.openURL)~~
  - add song selection without changing songs
  - add a settings panel which includes
    - quality settings: 256, 512, 1024, 2048, auto (remember quality factors:
  	  size/4, division function, waveform/10 division in draw and dtscounter
	  and fade, and scaling i)
	  - maybe auto scale sample size option depending on song for maximum quality
	- file visualization saving option: off, automatic, manual (greatly improves performance at the cost of disk space)
	  - option to delete saves
	- tick distance slider (inside settings menu for default vis)
	- screen ratio setting: 16/10, 16/9, 4/3
	- fade options: toggle, turn off bloom, intensity slider (right side for louder songs, left for softer), auto
	- more color options
  - ~~move music folder to appdata~~
  - maybe move fft to its own thread/coroutine
  - make a gui for the visualizer (need to research, learn how to implement, designs, etc)
  - optimize icon
  - understand fft library to potentially increase efficiency
  - potentially use a better fft library made in C through FFI
  - ~~read and evaluate how https://github.com/Sulunia/love2d-fftvis and https://github.com/opatut/VisuaLove handle ffts~~
  - fix fade average to scale with different qualities
  - fix scaling differences between Mac and Windows
  - fix title overwrite when adding additional folders

##### Researched/unfinished:
  - potential fft overlap NOTE: turns out the benefits from fixing the overlap were not great enough for the extra processing power and memory requirements necessary.  Actually ended up making things a lot worse.  The implementation consisted of calculating the fft in real-time separate from love.update, storing it in memory once some compression/optimization was preformed, obtaining it when the sample time appeared for love.draw, then removing it from memory once used.
  - when behind windows disable visualizer calcs NOTE: can't do this atm (10.2) bc love uses SDL which has issues implementing this.  Currently implemented, but likely error-prone need to test further on other computers
  - fix background detection on windows: can't because Love uses SDL to handle these things and it's bugged
